        <p id="thing">The purpose of the differential assembly is to allow the two drive wheels to turn at different speeds when the car
            goes around a corner. This is necessary because when cornering, the wheel on the inside of the turn goes through
            a smaller arc or corner than the wheels on the outside. If the wheels were not allowed to turn at different speeds,
            they would tend to skip around the corner and steering would be very difficult.

        <p id="thing">The functions of the final drive are to provide a permanent speed          reduction and also to turn the drive round
            through 90Â°. The reduction provided is about 4:1 in cars and 10:1 in heavier vehicles. This is done either in one or
            two stages. For lesser reduction, say up to about 7:1 single reduction is used, while higher reductions are achieved in two steps.The Final Drive is the last gearing used while transmitting the engine power to the wheels. It has two purposes. Firstly, it turns the power flow at the right angle from the propeller shaft to the rear axle. Secondly, it also provides a mechanical advantage (leverage) from the propeller shaft to the rear axle. The Final drive contains a pair of spiral-bevel gears comprising a pinion that connects to the propeller shaft and a ring gear that connects to a flange on the differential case.

            The final drive in practice consists of a bevel pinion and a crown wheel or alternativel,y, worm and wheel
            arrangement. The bevel pinion is mounted on a shaft which is connected to the propeller shaft generally through
            a universal joint. From the crown wheel the drive goes to the differential.
            <br>
            Three types of gears are used for the final drive gearing. <br>
            1. Straight Bevel Gears <br>
            2. Spiral Bevel Gears <br>
            3. Hypoid Gears

            1. Straight Bevel Gears: These contain the straight teeth. They are the simplest and the cheapest of all types.However, with straight bevel gears, at one instant only one pair of teeth of pinion and the crown wheel will be in contact. As a result an uneven transmission of motion will take place as the load is transferred from one pair of teeth to the next. Thus these gears are noisy and suffer from high wear.
            Straight bevel gears have many different uses across industries such as industrial and commercial, material handling, automotive, pumps, and many other industries.  <br><br>

            2. Spiral Bevel Gears: The spiral bevel gears have curved teeth which result in greater contact of the teeth. Because of this spiral bevel gears are silent in running and stronger than the straight bevel gears.The main application of this is in a vehicle differential, where the direction of drive from the drive shaft must be turned 90 degrees to drive the wheels. <br>
            3. Hypoid Gears: These types of gears are widely used for final drive these days. In this the pinion shaft is placed below the axis of the crown wheel. This permits a lower position of the propeller shaft, thus allowing low chassis height. The name 'hypoid' is derived from the 'hyperboloid of revolution'. The basic surface on which the teetha  re cut in their case, is hyperboloid, which is a solid obtained by rotating a hyperbola about an offset axis.
