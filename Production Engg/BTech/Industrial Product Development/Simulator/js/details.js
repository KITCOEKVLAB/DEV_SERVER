        aim : `To print The Prototype Part using FDM based Printer`,

        // For theory is is not a single quote it is called string literal in javascript
        // So by mistake you removed it just press the button above tab and to the left of number 1 button.

        theory: `
        1.	In FDM CAD files must be translated into a file type, that 3D printing machines can understand.
        <br><br>2.	Standard Tessellation Language (STL) is one such file type and is the language most commonly used for stereolithography, 
        <br><br>3.	The file is digitally sliced into a series of parallel horizontal cross--‚Äêsections which are then provided to a FDM one at a time.
        <br><br>4.	Since additive manufacturing works by adding one layer of material on top of another, CAD models must be broken up into layers before being printed in three dimensions. 
        <br><br>5.	FDM is the second most widely used rapid prototyping technology, after stereolithography. 
        <br><br>6.  In Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) process a temperature-controlled head extrudes thermoplastic material layer by layer.
        <br><br>7.	The FDM process starts with importing an STL file of a model into a pre-processing software. This model is mathematically sliced into horizontal layers varying from +/- 0.127 - 0.254 mm thickness. After generating the toolpaths, the data is downloaded to the FDM machine.

        <h3>DISCRIPTION OF APPARATUS </h3>
        <br><br>1.  As the nozzle is moved over the table in the required geometry, it deposits a thin bead of extruded plastic to form each layer. 
        <br><br>2.  The plastic hardens immediately after being discharged from the nozzle and bonds to the layer below. 
        <br><br>3.  The object is built on a mechanical stage which moves vertically downward layer by layer as the part is formed. 
        <br><br>4.  The entire system is contained within a chamber which is held at a temperature just below the melting point of the plastic.
        <hr>
        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <br><br>1.  FDM Models are Strong and Durable.
        <br><br>2.  Models are Stable and never warp / shrink
        <br><br>3.  Models can go through milling, tapping and boring operations
        <br><br>4.  Models can be sanded, painted and finished as required
        <br><br>5.  Models can be sanded, painted and finished as required
        <br><br>6.  Models are non toxic and safe to handle 
        <br><br>7.  ABS material can be used
        <br><br>8.  Multiple material colors can be obtained
        <hr>
        <h3>Limitations:</h3>
        <br><br>1.  Process is comparatively slower for larger parts.
        <br><br>2  Support structures are required (sometimes may require more support material than the part itself).
        <br><br>3.  The finished parts are anisotropic, that is they exhibit different mechanical characteristics in different directio1.  
        <hr>
        <h3>Applications:</h3>
        <br><br>1.  The resolution is not as fine as with stereolithography
        <br><br>2.  Prototypes for functional testing; you can install and run the parts in your production intent material for the best possible proof that your design really works
        <br><br>3.  Prototypes for form and fit testing
        <br><br>4.  Prototypes directly constructed in production materials
        <br><br>5.  Quality parts with a high structural stability
        <br><br>6.  Durable single piece parts up to 900 x 600 x 900 1.
